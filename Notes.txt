We will be running the MongoDB on MongoDB Atlas.
We get the URI of the cluster in Atlas, and put that as environment variable in .env. Then we initialize
the connection to the database at the beginning of our app.


It is with this mongodb database that we will be able to perform CRUD operations.

We start with Schemas. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection. It defines the shape of the 
   documents within that collection. Schemas are building block for Models. A model allows you 
   to create instances of your objects, called documents.


The done() function is a callback that tells us that we can proceed after completing an 
   asynchronous operation such as inserting, searching, updating, or deleting. It's following 
   the Node convention, and should be called as done(null, data) on success, or done(err) on 
   error.

/* Example */
const someFunc = function(done) {
  //... do something (risky) ...
  if (error) return done(error);
  done(null, result);
};
